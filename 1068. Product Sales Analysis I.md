(sale_id, year) is the primary key of this table.
product_id is a foreign key to Product table.
Each row of this table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Note that the price is per unit.

| Column Name  | Type    |

| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.

Write an SQL query that reports the product_name, year, and price for each sale_id in the Sales table.

## Solution
SELECT product_name, year, price FROM Sales as s
INNER JOIN Product as p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id

Solution notes: Since we are given that product_id is the foreign key between the two tables, we use that for our join.
