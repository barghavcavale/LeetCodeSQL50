(id, unique_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.

## Solution
SELECT unique_id, name from EmployeeUNI as a
RIGHT JOIN Employees as b
ON a.id = b.id

A right join is used here as you want all the names from the Employees column. By default, if it can't find a unique ID then it puts a NULL in the table
