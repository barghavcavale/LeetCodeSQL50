transaction_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.

Write a SQL query to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

## Solution

SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
from Visits v 
LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id  
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL 
GROUP BY v.customer_id; 

Notes: There where condition is very important here along with the GROUP BY condition
