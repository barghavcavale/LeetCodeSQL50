id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

## Solution
Join the Weather table with itself, denoting the first occurrence as w1 and the second occurrence as w2.
Compare the dates of w1 and w2 using the DATEDIFF() function to check if they are consecutive days (with a difference of 1 day).
Add a condition in the WHERE clause to select the rows where the temperature of w1 is greater than the temperature of w2.
Select the id of w1 as the result.
