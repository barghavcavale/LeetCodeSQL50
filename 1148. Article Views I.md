## 1148. Article Views I
Table: Views

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 

Find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

## Solution
SELECT DISTINCT author_id as id from Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY author_id ASC;

Things to keep in mind for this question:
1. We need to change the name of the field so we use the "as" keyword in the first line, we can also see a new operator, SELECT DISTINCT as opposed to SELECT
2. WHERE clauses come before ORDER BY
3. ORDER BY <field_name> ASC/DESC based on what you need - if you don't specify, the default is ASC
